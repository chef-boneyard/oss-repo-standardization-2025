# Repository Standarization - Forking

As part of the OSS repo standardization process, many repos are being [selected](categorization.md) for [decommissioning](decommissioning.md). If you wish a repo to continue (or to resume to be) maintained, a common option is **forking**.

## What is forking?

Forking is basically copying, with a change of virtual ownership, maintaining copyright and license. It is common and permitted under most open-source licenses. The most common license used by Chef, Apache V2, permits forking.

 

## Why would I fork a decommissioning repo?

When a repo is decommissioned, it means Progress is no longer making any effort to maintain the project. Progress is going to make its copy of the content read-only and no longer accept updates. If you wish to see ongoing development of the project, you will need a copy of your own.

However, this means you are taking on the responsibility and workload of developing the code in the project, including keeping up with platform updates and security releases in dependencies.

## Must I maintain the project myself?

No, you may find some other volunteer, hire someone, or form an alliance of like-minded indivduals.

## What is a designated successor?

As part of the decommissioning process, Progress will be updating the README of each project with a note explaining the archive event. If Progress knows the repo is being forked and someone has volunteered (at the time of archival) to take on maintenance, it is possible for Progress to link to the new copy (fork) of the project, for the convenience of existing users. This is known as a **designated successor fork**.

Progress is under no obligation to post any such message in any particular case, and makes no endorsement and is not affilaited with any designated successor fork or maintainer.

## How can I tell Progress I want to be designated as a successor?
