# Removing SLA Statements from READMEs - FAQ

## What is happening?

Many Chef-owned GitHub repositories contain, in their README, a statement indicating that issues and pull requests will be serviced within a certain timeframe. As part of an initiative to standardize governance of Chef GitHub repositories, Chef is removing these SLA statements from all repos.

## Why is this happening?

As Chef has evolved over the years, we have learned that effort is spent not so much on a per repo basis, but on a per product basis. Our products span multiple repos. The lifecycle of repositories may include long periods of stability, and our products are highly componentized. Thus it is more appropriate to have responses that are more focused at a product level.  Because of this, focusing on response times to any particular repository is misleading and unhelpful, and can be a waste of engineering resources.

## Does this affect the actual level of service recieved by Chef Customers?

Nothing will change in terms of Progress Chef's behavior towards the maintenance of these repositories, and customers can still expect the same level of service they have come to enjoy. 

## How can I request an update to a repo?

As usual, GitHub users can open issues on the affected repository, or better yet, submit a PR with a suggested approach to a fix.

## How can I escalate a request?

Chef customers may contact their acount representative.
